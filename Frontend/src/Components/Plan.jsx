                            <p>Sophia and Emily were very much alike. Both were six years old, living in the same neighborhood, and attending the same elementary school. They both loved fairy tales and fruit snacks.</p>

                            <p>Mia, Alex, and Jake were very alike. All three were six years old and went to the same school in the same small town. They loved sharing comic books and snacking on string cheese.</p>
                            <p>As they progressed through middle school and high school, Mia usually did well on her homework and ended up on the honor roll almost every quarter. Alex, too, managed to excel and stayed at the top of his class. But Jake struggled to concentrate, earning mostly C’s.</p>
                            <p>Mia and Alex went on to attend prestigious universities, making lots of friends and valuable connections; Jake never went. Mia and Alex went on to enjoy successful careers; Jake had to take whatever he could get.</p>
